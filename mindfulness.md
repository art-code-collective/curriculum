# Mindfulness

## Learning

<!-- Intro header notes: why talk about mindfulness? -->

> Strike while the iron is hot, it's easier to learn while you are learning. You can learn more than you realize. Some discussion about mindfulness may not seem related at first to what you are learning. Considering a little about how we learn can show how we might better learn, or learn better what to expect while learning

Throughout the learning process, we improvise solutions to anticipated but also particular unanticipated problems that spontaneously present themselves. We may also find our expectations violated with anticipated problems, finding that these problems warrant different considerstions and have different dynamics than we had originally figured.

The learning process involves trying out and discarding our mental theories or hypotheses about a problem. Our mind are constantly trying to infer patterns and turn them into narratives about our world.

Frequently, as programmers we create narratives about how our program is working or should work. The narrative might go like this: the click-handler function triggers a form to open *only when a button to show the form is clicked* and the form appears only when that show form button is clicked.

Often our code will not conform to the narratives about how our program is working, and we have to diagnose the problem. The diagnosis takes the form of a narrative about how our programs are actually working. Often, as a result of creating that diagnostic narrative about how our program is actually working, we refine our narratives about how our program is working, and our narratives become more technical, specific, and detailed.

On the way, we discard a lot of thoughts about how are program is working, finding that those thoughts aren't true. This process is mentally intensive. Over time, through mindfulness techniques, we can learn a certain detachment from these thoughts about how our programs, or how any narrative really, is working. This has less to do with radical skepticism towards concepts, the world, or one's thinking, and more to do with cultivating mindfullness practices and developing intuitions about the mind's processes when dealing with unknowns. You become more comfortable with not knowing.

Over months, you will become more comfortable walking into a dark room trying to find lightswitches. It will be often that you're in a situation where you walk into such a room only to find that the lightswitch you need to turn on is controlled by other lightswitches, and you will have to switch them on in a certain order or discover the right conditions.

#### Hitting Blocks

When we have exhausted our narratives about how our program is working, and tried fixes that logically follow from our narratives, we mentally experience a block. Maybe our fix is wrong but our narrative is right, maybe our narrative is wrong. Maybe our narrative isn't so much as wrong as it is unrelated to how our program is actually working, and we need to create a new narrative entirely.

## Emotions
<!--  TODO: Disclaimer? -->

### Joy & Pride

- Chance to reflect, celebrate wins aspittel style.
- Chance to reframe self criticism


### Self-Critical

- Can feel like shame, embarrasment, impostor syndrome

### Boredom

We can tend to feel boredom when blocked. Maybe we are excited about creating a particular thing or app, but we get bored when faced with the techinical aspect, or the idea of writing boilerplate and spinning up a develop environment. There are ways to circumvent slowdowns that can inspire boredom, like using tools other people have written to speed up the development process, but eventually we will probably experience deep boredom. We can learn to strategically take breaks, and find things to do during those breaks that make easier to take strategically. Mindfulness activities are well-suited to such breaks. Boredom can be a helpful indicator that your brain needs a reset. Changing the way you think about it can reduce anxiety and feeling generally inhibited as developer. It's not as bad when you know what to expect and have practiced dealing with it.

#### Boredom and Deep Work

Developing a tolerance for boredom is crucial to doing deep work.

#### Boredom & Frustration

> Boredom is the mask that frustration wears

## Responding to Criticism

<!-- TODO: HYPER-DISCLAIMER -->

### Technical Criticism

> importance of celebrating wins,  seeing how far you've come

Seing how far you've come can remind you how much you've learned, and is evidence that you can, will, and do learn all the time. You can, will, and do improve.

### Criticism of your Social Conduct

Sometimes we inadvertantly offend or hurt people,  and we are asked or discover it is necessary to change our thinking and conduct.

#### How to discover how you can improve

- finding resources
- finding reasons for developing good faith and trust
- comfort with vulnerability
